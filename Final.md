Does the project have a clearly stated goal/question(s)?

Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu were the pioneers of the streaming service industry. Since around 2020 competition has increased dramatically. Many streaming services have been introduced leading to these pioneers losing their rights to movies or losing their customers to other services. 

I want to explore 

 1) How have Hulu, Netflix, and Prime changed their business strategy since the introduction of new competitors?
 2) Has the change in business strategy been successful? Are people still interested in the original streaming services?
 3) What are the differences in the main streaming services?
 
 ### How have Hulu, Netflix, and Prime changed their business strategy since the introduction of new competitors?
 
Streaming services make profit by charging their customers a subscription price. This subscription price leads to the streaming services paying wages, rights to movies, content spend and many more. Obviously these streaming services can't just increase subscription price in order to just make more money to counteract the fleeing customers. This would just cause more customers to leave at a certain point. To maintain customers or win new ones, these original streaming services need to increase their content spend. 
 
To demonstrate how this has changed, It is important to look at the before and after of content spend over recent years.

On the left we can see the overall content spend in billions of dollars. Most of the companies are on a strong upward trajectory with the exception of netflix in 2020 which was impacted strongly by the pandemic. Netflix did however plan on spending $17 billion which would have fit its previous trend. It should be noted that Hulu is only available in the US and Japan so their content spend is expected to be much lower. To account for this, the percent change chart on the right show by how much these services are increasing their spending relative to the last year.
