Does the project have a clearly stated goal/question(s)?

Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu were the pioneers of the streaming service industry. Since around 2020 competition has increased dramatically. Many streaming services have been introduced leading to these pioneers losing their rights to movies or losing their customers to other services. 

I want to explore 

 1) How have Hulu, Netflix, and Prime changed their business strategy since the introduction of new competitors?
 2) Has the change in business strategy been successful? Are people still interested in the original streaming services?
 3) What are the differences in the main streaming services?
 4) If I wanted to enter the streaming industry, what would be the best strategy?
 
 ## How have Hulu, Netflix, and Prime changed their business strategy since the introduction of new competitors?
 
Streaming services make profit by charging their customers a subscription price. This subscription price leads to the streaming services paying wages, rights to movies, content spend and many more. Obviously these streaming services can't just increase subscription price in order to just make more money to counteract the fleeing customers. This would just cause more customers to leave at a certain point. To maintain customers or win new ones, these original streaming services need to increase their content spend. 
 
To demonstrate how this has changed, It is important to look at the before and after of content spend over recent years.

On the left we can see the overall content spend in billions of dollars. Most of the companies are on a strong upward trajectory with the exception of netflix in 2020 which was impacted strongly by the pandemic. Netflix did however plan on spending $17 billion which would have fit its previous trend. It should be noted that Hulu is only available in the US and Japan so their content spend is expected to be much lower. To account for this, the percent change chart on the right show by how much these services are increasing their spending relative to the last year. 

We can see the following results. Netflix and Prime are averaging around 20% increase in content spend each year. Hulu is recently begining to increase it's content spend in the last few years. 

Now we can look at the change these companies have made after the surge of new streaming services.

*Note: HBO max was released after 2020 so no data is present.*

We now see that Netflix and Hulu had an immediate reaction to increase content spend as more streaming services entered the market. This increase in spend is either due to increasing cost to video rights or increase in spend for originals. Either way, both of these services had an immediate reaction to increase spend to retain attraction to their service. 
Prime video on the other hand decided to continue with it's normal spending staying at roughly the same increasing trend as before. Disney now leads content spend and HBO is spending the same as Netflix. Neither of these should be suprising as Disney has always been head of video entertainment and HBO (owned by Warner Bros) has been another massive name.

## Has the change in business strategy been successful? Are people still interested in the original streaming services?

In order to look at the success of the companies in the streaming wars, we need to look ask the consumers who they think is the best. There isn't a stat or metric that a company can display to show who, "is the best", the only metric to determine that are the consumers themselves. According to a poll done by the observer asking, "If you could only pick one service, who would it be?" We are able to determine the success.

In the last section we talked about how Netflix and Hulu both adjusted for new competitors by increasing their content spend while Prime kept increasing at it's previous rate. Here we may see a consequence of that as both Netlfix and Hulu lead in consumer preference while Prime is at 5th. The combination of Increasing content spend and the mere exposure effect are likely the reason Netflix and Hulu are leaders. For Netflix and Hulu to be able to outperform video entertainment giants of Disney and Warner Bros (HBO), it is safe to say they have dealt with the transition of competition well and have had a successful business strategy.

## What are the differences in the main streaming services?

An intriguing conclusion from the last section is the amount of content spend that Disney is using, and the lack of relative success they were having. To look at what may cause this, it is important to investigate the differences between the services.

*Note : HBO max doesn't have publicly available datsets so they are excluded* 

The graph shows what might be the main reasoning behind Disney not being the number one choice of service despite outspending everyone on content. Disney produces almost all of it's content for poeple of all ages and children over the age of 7. That is almost 90% of the content that it produces. Looking at it's competitors, there is a large distribution of movie ratings for people of all age ranges to enjoy. What is incredibly fascinating is taking a closer look at those movies 13+. Those movies are actually some of the most renound such as Pirates of the Carribean, Deadpool, and Percy Jackson. Disney is however mainly targetting children, and without a brand shift is unlikely to ever be the leader of streaming services.

Looking outside of variation in movie ratings, we can look at overall movie quality. Rotten Tomatoes is a movie review website which is a well trusted recommendation resource that provides an aggregate score of movies. We can look at all of the movies each service has which may be able to demonstrate how each service is different.

Now we can see what may draw specific customers to each streaming service. Netflix has some of the absolute greatest movies throughout all four of these streaming services. This can be seen by a large number of outliers that appear to be beyond any of the other services movies. This means that Netflix, according to Rotten Tomatoes, has the top heavy best of these four streaming services. With Hulu, we can see that on average, a consumer will get a better movie than any other streaming service. Disney, as discussed before, prioritizes kids movies and most are rated rather well. Prime doesn't necessarily win in any statistical category, but it does have the most movies.
